## Use a Podigee Theme as base

To get started quickly you can clone one of our themes and change the layout and CSS to your liking. To do that choose **Themes** from the Main menu in the top navigation.

When the theme was copied you directly get to the editing interface where you can edit the name of your new theme by clicking **Edit** in the top-right corner and type your desired name into the text field.

Below the general information about the theme you see a list of files which you can edit to you liking. You can also add new files or remove the ones that you don't need any more.

More information on how to edit a theme is covered in the [Theme Editor Documentation](/guides/themes/editor/). Information on which attributes you can use in your templates can be found in the [Theme attribute reference](/guides/themes/custom_template_attribute_reference/).

## Starting from scratch

If you want to develop your own theme from scratch just choose **Themes** from the top navigation menu. Once your on the theme overview page simply click **Add theme** in the upper right corner. We will already create some files for you so you can get started right away.
