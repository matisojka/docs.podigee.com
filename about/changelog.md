### New file upload
We had to switch away from our _old_ file upload method. We have been using a service for uploading files until today but had to switch away from it because of pricing changes which simply do not fit into our use-case.

Therefore the interface to upload files has been slightly changed and we also had to remove the Dropbox and Google Drive upload functionality for now (Don't worry, they will return soon!).

* Also, we moved the **Media Files** Tab to the first position on the Episode-Page
