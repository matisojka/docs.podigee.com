### Big update for the user interface

Today we pushed out our biggest update yet.

With this update we introduce a more straight forward user interface for creating and
editing podcasts and episodes. The **Edit** button is gone and fields can edited
directly now. Additionally we added auto-saving for even less unnecessary clicking.

### Cover images for audio files

We now add the Pocast cover image as cover for audio files. Additionally it will be displayed in the web-player. The possibility to override the cover image per episode will follow soon.

A new theme has been added! Just go to your Blog settings and choose 'One column' as your theme to use it.

### Pagination for blogs

The overview pages of the blogs are now paginated. For now there will be 10 episodes on each page. If there is demand for it we will make this number configurable in the future.

### About page for blogs

Blogs now have an about page. You can find an example here: <http://podigee-de.podigee.io/about>

### Going responsive

We improved usability on small screen devices like phones and tablets a lot. You should now be able to do most of the tasks you can do on your desktop on the road.

### Dropbox is back

We have re-enabled audio clip upload via Dropbox.

### New file upload
We had to switch away from our _old_ file upload method. We have been using a service for uploading files until today but had to switch away from it because of pricing changes which simply do not fit into our use-case.

Therefore the interface to upload files has been slightly changed and we also had to remove the Dropbox and Google Drive upload functionality for now (Don't worry, they will return soon!).

### Some interface improvements
* We renamed the **Texts** tab on the Podcast- and Episode-Pages to **General**
* Also, we moved the **Media Files** Tab to the first position on the Episode-Page
