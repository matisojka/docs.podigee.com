<dt>Can I import my existing podcast?</dt>
<dd>Yes, and even better, we will do most of the work for you and guide you through all the necessary steps to make your migration as seemless as possible for you and your audience.</dd>

<dt>What data can be migrated</dt>
<dd>Basically everything that is exposed in your Podcast feed (including media files of course). If that is not enough for you, get in touch and we'll see what we can do beyond this.</dd>

<dt>What about my existing feed subscribers?</dt>
<dd>We'll try to make sure you loose none of your valuable listeners/viewers when migrating to Podigee.
<br>
To be transparent with this: <em>Trying</em> means, that in some cases it will be pretty difficult to achieve a seemless migration and in some it won't be possible at all, but we'll try everything we can to make it work.</dd>

<dt>What if I cancel my account?</dt>
<dd>Should you decide to cancel your account, you will be able to download your complete Podcast-Archive including all metadata. Additionally we will set up a redirect from your podigee.io subdomain and your feed to your new podcast page and feed.
</dd>

<dt>Can I use my own domain?</dt>
<dd>Yes, you can! If you don't want to use a subdomain like yourpodcast.podigee.io you can set up your Podigee podcast to be available on your own domain.</dd>

<dt>Do I need to set up my own Blogging-Software (like WordPress)?</dt>
<dd>No, you don't. We provide you with a podcast optimized blog. You can choose between several pre-made themes or roll your own with our custom-theme editor.</dd>
